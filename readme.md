This is a work-in-progress respository for Finanicial Data Science class ('FBV_WS202500015') taught at KIT.

All results are my own, but pass the official checker. If you find errors or are in the mood to discuss results, please let me know through a PR or an issue.

I'll gradually add all the remaining '.pynb' files. I just want to review them, to make sure I incorporate, what I learned in later parts of the course.
